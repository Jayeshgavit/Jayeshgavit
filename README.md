Hi, I'm Jayesh Gavit! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in IT at MVPSâ€™s KBT COE, Nashik. I previously completed a Diploma in Computer Technology from K.K. Wagh Polytechnic, Nashik.

ðŸš€ I'm a computer enthusiast with a strong passion for learning and exploring new technologies. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my skills in Python and frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

ðŸŒ± I'm always looking to improve and enjoy facing challenges with honesty and excitement. As a fresher, I'm eager to learn and work on interesting projects.

ðŸŽ® Hobbies: When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me playing video games or listening to audiobooks.
